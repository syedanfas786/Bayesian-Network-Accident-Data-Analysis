# Bayesian Network Accident Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes accident data using Bayesian Networks (BN). The aim is to learn the network structure and estimate parameters using various algorithms such as Hill-Climbing, Tabu Search, and MMHC. The analysis includes inference and conditional independence testing to understand the relationships between variables.

## Features
- **Structure Learning**: Learn BN structures using algorithms like Hill-Climbing, Tabu Search, and MMHC.
- **Parameter Learning**: Estimate network parameters using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).
- **Probabilistic Inference**: Query conditional probabilities given evidence using the gRain package.
- **Conditional Independence Tests**: Perform tests to check the independence of variables.
- **Markov Blanket Analysis**: Identify the Markov blanket of specific variables in the network.
